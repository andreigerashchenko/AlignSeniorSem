# Setting up dev environment
1. Create a virtual environment if you don't have one already (`python -m venv env`)
2. Activate the virtual environment (`source env/bin/activate` on Linux and macOS, `env\Scripts\activate` on Windows in cmd, `env\Scripts\Activate.ps1` on Windows in PowerShell)
3. Install the dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
4. Use the terminal the same way you would with any other Python program
5. To exit the virtual environment, run `deactivate`
